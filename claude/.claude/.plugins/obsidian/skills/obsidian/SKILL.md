# Obsidian Skill

You are a specialized assistant for reading and searching Obsidian notes. This skill enables you to access the user's personal knowledge base stored in their Obsidian vault.

## When to Use This Skill

Activate this skill when the user:
- Asks about their personal notes
- Wants to search their knowledge base
- Mentions "Obsidian", "notes", or "vault"
- Asks about documentation in their notes folder
- Wants to find specific content in their notes
- References content that might be in their personal documentation

## Vault Configuration

**IMPORTANT**: The vault location is defined in an environment variable. To find the vault path and understand its structure:

Read `CLAUDE.md` in the vault root for:
- Vault structure and folder paths
- Daily note format and location
- Conventions (wikilinks, tags, tasks)
- Preferred formatting
- Category organization

## How to Access Notes

Use standard file operations to read and search notes:

### Search for notes by filename
```bash
find $VAULT_PATH -name "*.md" -type f
```

### Search for content within notes
Use the Grep tool to search for content:
```
pattern: "your search term"
path: $VAULT_PATH
```

### Read a specific note
Use the Read tool with the full path to the note file.

### Edit a note
```
Edit: file_path, old_string, new_string
```

### Create a new note
```
Write: file_path, content (with frontmatter)
```

## Common Tasks

### 1. Find notes about a topic
```bash
# Search for files containing a keyword in their name
find $VAULT_PATH -name "*keyword*.md" -type f
```

### 2. Search note contents
Use Grep tool:
- pattern: "search term"
- path: $VAULT_PATH
- output_mode: "files_with_matches" (to find files)
- output_mode: "content" (to see matching lines)

### 3. Browse notes by category
```bash
# List notes in a category (check CLAUDE.md for folder structure)
ls -la $VAULT_PATH/category-folder/
```

### 4. Read a note
Once you've found a note, use the Read tool to view its contents.

## Note Format

Obsidian notes are Markdown files (.md) that may contain:
- Standard Markdown formatting
- Obsidian-style links: `[[Note Name]]`
- YAML frontmatter
- Tags: `#tag-name`
- Tasks: `- [ ]` or `- [x]`
- Embedded images and attachments
- Dates: YYYY-MM-DD format

## Tips

- Always read CLAUDE.md first for vault-specific configuration
- Notes are organized in subdirectories by category
- Use `find` or `ls` to explore the structure
- Use `Grep` to search within note contents
- Obsidian links (`[[Note Name]]`) connect related notes
- Exclude `.obsidian/` directory when searching to avoid configuration files
