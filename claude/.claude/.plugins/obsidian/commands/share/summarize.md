## Steps

1. Read `/home/maxime/NOTES/CLAUDE.md` for:

   - Where to save summaries

2. Find and read the target note (search by name if needed)

4. Analyze content:
   - Identify main topics and themes
   - Extract key points
   - Note structure and sections
   - Find actionable items
   - Identify important links and references

5. Generate concise summary:
   - **TL;DR**: 1-2 sentence overview
   - **Key Points**: Bullet list of main ideas
   - **Topics**: Main subjects covered
   - **Actionables**: Any tasks or next steps
   - **References**: Important links to other notes

6. Format summary (options):
   - Add to top of original note under `## Summary`
   - Create separate summary note: `<note-name>-Summary.md`
   - Output only (no save)

Keep summaries concise (typically 10-20% of original length). Preserve essential context and decisions. Use `[[wikilinks]]` for references.
