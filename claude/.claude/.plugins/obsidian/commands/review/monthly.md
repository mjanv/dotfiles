Generate a comprehensive summary of the current or specified month.

## Steps

1. Read `/home/maxime/NOTES/CLAUDE.md` for:
   - Monthly summary structure
   - Weekly summaries location
   - Metrics to aggregate

2. Determine month (current month or specified YYYY-MM)

3. Find all weekly summaries for the month (Weekly/YYYY-WXX.md)

4. Read each weekly summary

5. Aggregate and synthesize:
   - Major accomplishments
   - Key projects and progress
   - Learning themes
   - Challenges overcome
   - Metrics (tasks, time, productivity trends)
   - Month-over-month comparison

6. Generate structured monthly summary

7. Ask user if they want to save to `Monthly/YYYY-MM.md`

Format: `YYYY-MM` for months. Group by themes, not just weekly rollup. Identify patterns and insights.
