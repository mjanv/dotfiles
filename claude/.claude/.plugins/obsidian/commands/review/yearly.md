Generate a comprehensive annual review from monthly summaries.

## Steps

1. Read `/home/maxime/NOTES/CLAUDE.md` for:
   - Yearly review structure
   - Monthly summaries location
   - Key themes to track

2. Determine year (current year or specified YYYY)

3. Find all monthly summaries for the year (Monthly/YYYY-MM.md)

4. Read each monthly summary

5. Aggregate and synthesize:
   - **Year Overview**: Major themes and highlights
   - **Accomplishments**: Key wins organized by domain (work, learning, personal, projects)
   - **Projects**: Completed, ongoing, archived
   - **Learning & Growth**: Skills acquired, courses completed, key insights
   - **Challenges**: Major obstacles overcome
   - **Decisions**: Important ADRs and strategic choices
   - **Metrics**: Annual totals (tasks, time, productivity patterns)
   - **Year-over-Year**: Compare with previous year if available
   - **Looking Forward**: Themes or priorities for next year

6. Generate structured annual review

7. Ask user if they want to save to `Yearly/YYYY.md`

Format: YYYY for years. Focus on big-picture themes and patterns, not just monthly rollup. Identify personal/professional growth, major shifts, and long-term trends.
